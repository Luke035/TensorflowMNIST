# TensorflowMNIST
Simple code to train and score MNIST model

This code make use of TRAINING and TEST set provied by KAGGLE in its <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer>Digit Recognizer</a> competition. In order to make the code functional you had to download data provided in the competition.

This work has been done expoliting <a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/contrib/learn/get_started/>tf.contrib.learn api<a> and its relative <a href=https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/learn> examples </a>

## Hardware and time clarifications
Training has been done with an NVIDIA QUADRO K1200 GPU and it took about <b>CHANGE HERE WHEN TRAIN STOPS</b> minutes to perform 100k iterations with 256 record per batch
